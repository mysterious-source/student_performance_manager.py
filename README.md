# Student Performance Management System

This is a Python console application that allows a user to:

- Add students and their subject marks
- View all students
- View individual student marks
- Calculate a student’s average score

## Concepts used
- Lists
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- User input/output

## Why I built this
I built this project to practice Python logic and understand how data can be managed in a real-world scenario like a school system.

This project is still improving as I learn more Python.
